    <Text>In 1992, it was my fifth year as\nmayor of our beautiful city. It\nwas then that through many\ndonations and hard work our city\nwas able to rebuild the municipal\nbuilding, create a state of the art\nhospital.</Text>
    <Text>In honor of these fine\naccomplishments, I was awarded\nwith a grand statue that same\nyear. The statue rests in the\nmunicipal building.</Text>
    <Text>I came to this city as an engineer\nmore than 35 years ago. I made\ncontributions to the electric\nsystems, and to the installation of\nthe cable car.\n\nI pledge to follow the tradition of\nthis fine city and will devote my\nlife to its prosperity.\n\n{right}The mayor of the city, \n{right}Michael Warren </Text>
