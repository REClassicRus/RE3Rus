    <Text>{center}MERCENARY'S DIARY</Text>
    <Text>September 1st\nFollowing six months of intensive\ntraining, my body's edge had\nreturned.\n\nI was a good soldier, but they\nordered my execution with no\nreason given. I was tortured and\nforced to give a false confession.</Text>
    <Text>But on the morning of my\nexecution, a miracle happened.\nThe company had helped me out,\ngiving me a second lease on life.\n</Text>
    <Text>September 15th\nI ended my vacation short and\nreturned to the HQ office. It looks\nlike my UBCS unit's been called\ninto action.</Text>
    <Text>Umbrella maintains its own\nparamilitary unit to counter\ncorporate terrorism and V.I.P.\nabduction. In addition, they have\nnightmen who specialize in handling\nproblems caused by illegal products.\n\nI'm currently a member of the\nlatter.</Text>
    <Text>September 28th\nDawn's here, but we're still\nslogging through this nightmare.\nThere are no provisions of any\nkind here. The undead walk the\nstreets feeding upon the flesh of\nthe living.\n</Text>
    <Text>Given the choice again, I would\nrather have been executed. Death\nrow was a heavenly asylum\ncompared to this place.\n\nI've chosen to pull the trigger\nmyself, in the hope that my dead\nbody won't come back to life.</Text>
