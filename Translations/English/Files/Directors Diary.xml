    <Text>{center}DIRECTOR'S DIARY</Text>
    <Text>September 10th\nThese patients suffer from\ngangrene and congestion of their\nblood at first. Then their mind\nslowly deteriorates. In the end,\nthere is nothing left of their mind.\nWhen that happens even mercy\nkilling seems pointless. After all,\nthey are already dead...</Text>
    <Text>This disease is unlike anything I\nhave ever witnessed. Once the\npatient's mind is gone, they become\nflesh hunger monsters and act like\nwild animals who are on some type\nof bloodlust.</Text>
    <Text>September 18th\nAnother patient has been admitted\nto the hospital. He is showing\nsymptoms of the first stages of\nthe disease at this point, but... I\nhaven't been able to sleep at all\nthese past few days. I refuse to\nlet these patients become "zombies."\nI am not just an ordinary citizen.\nI am a doctor. Even if I die, my\nclinical charts will contribute to\nfinding a cure.</Text>
    <Text>September 26th\nWe lost most of the doctors and\nstaff during the battle against the\n"zombie" patients. It's impossible to\nmaintain the hospital under these\nconditions. And, I know that it's\ntoo late for me. I am beginning to\nfeel that same itchy and hungry\ndesire that all of my patients felt.\nIt's too late for me... </Text>
