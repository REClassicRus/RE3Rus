    <Text>April 25th\nToday is my 30th birthday. I was\ntransferred to this facility today.\nI am very happy because the work\nenvironment is very different from\nlife in the university.\n</Text>
    <Text>May 14th\nThe disposal system has been\ncompleted. Using a special kind of\ngas, it can decompose the cells of\nthe guinea pigs. We have to try\nthis out before beginning practical\nusage of the system, since it is\nnot 100% stable yet.</Text>

I have continued to work,\nbut I always keep a gun with me.</Text>
    <Text>I must remember to save one\nbullet for me. I want to weep. I\ndon't want to die here. I swear\nthat I'll lose my mind if I imagine\nhow painful the death will be... </Text>
