    <Text>{center}JILL'S DIARY</Text>
    <Text>August 7th\nTwo weeks have passed since that\nday. My wounds have been healed,\nbut I just can't forget it. For\nmost people, it's history now. But\nfor me, whenever I close my eyes,\nit all comes back clearly. Zombies\neating people's flesh and the\nscreams of my teammates dying. No,\nthe wounds in my heart are not\nhealed yet...</Text>
    <Text>August 13th\nChris has been causing a lot of\ntrouble recently. What's with him?\nHe seldom talks to the other police\nmembers and is constantly\nirritated. The other day, he\npunched Elran of the Boy's Crime\ndepartment just for accidentally\nsplashing Chris's face with coffee.</Text>
    <Text>I immediately stopped Chris, but\nwhen he saw me by just gave me a\nwink and walk away. I wonder\nwhat happened to him...</Text>
    <Text>August 15th\nMidnight. Chris, who has been on a\nleave of absence for a "vacation,"\ncalled me so I visited his\napartment. As soon as I walked\ninto his room, he showed me a\ncouple of pieces of paper. They\nwere part of a virus research\nreport entitled as simply as "G".</Text>
    <Text>August 24th\nChris left the town today to go\nto Europe. Barry told me that he\nwould send his family to Canada\nand then he would follow Chris. I\ndecided to remain in Raccoon City\nfor a while because I know that\nthe research facility in this city\nwill be very important to this\nentire case.</Text>
    <Text>In a month or so, I'll be joining\nwith them somewhere in Europe.\nThat's when my real battle begins...</Text>
