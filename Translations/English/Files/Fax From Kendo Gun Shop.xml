    <Text>{center}FAX FROM KENDO GUN SHOP</Text>
    <Text>To the boys at S.T.A.R.S.,\n\nI have some good news for you\nfrom my brother Joe. He has\nfinalized the new hand-gun for\nofficial use. Its the M92F S.T.A.R.S.\nSpecial, but he calls it the\n"Samurai Edge." It's the most\nbalanced of the Kendo custom guns.</Text>
    <Text>Joe said, if you miss the targets\nwith this, you should carry a\nteething ring instead of a gun in\nyour holster.</Text>
    <Text></Text>
    <Text>The goods will be delivered along\nwith their proper documentation.\nI'm sure you'll be surprised when\nyou see what kind of excellent\nparts are used for the M92F. I\nknow that you'll want to thank\nthe good people who developed it.\n</Text>
    <Text>Sincerely,\n{RIGHT}Robert Kendo \n{RIGHT}Kendo Gun Shop </Text>
