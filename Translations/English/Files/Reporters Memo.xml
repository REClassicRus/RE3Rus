    <Text>{center}REPORTER'S MEMO</Text>
    <Text>At last I have found the\nevidence I need to prove that the\n"Cannibal Disease" is indeed\nhappening in this city.\nOne man actually ate people to\ndeath. He was like a savage animal\ntearing away a new flesh. It was\ncompletely disgusting. I have heard\nrumors that many people are also\nsuffering from this disease now.</Text>
    <Text>However, the causes of the disease\nis not yet known. Is this another\nmystery of the present disease? I\nwill have to check on it...\n\nThey have placed Raccoon City\nunder martial law because of the\ncannibal disease. I have lost\ncontact with the media outside of\nthe city, but I won't give up.</Text>
    <Text>As a journalist, I won't keep my\neyes shut and walk away. I have\na duty to the people and my\nprofession. I don't think the\ndisease has spread nationwide yet.\nI believe that this city holds the\nkey to its creation and cure. In\nfact, I'm sure of it.</Text>
    <Text>The military has set up blockades\naround the city to keep people\nfrom escaping and spreading the\ndisease. Most of the citizens have\neither died or have come in\ncontact with the disease. I know\nthat it is the right decision to\nquarantine the city, but I can't\nhelp but pity myself.</Text>
    <Text>If I am infected or eaten, it\ndoesn't matter. My fate is already\nsealed. All I have left is my journalism.\n\nI won't give up until I solve the\nmystery of this deadly disease. I\nhave just discovered that the\ndisease is not spread through the\nair, but by some other means.</Text>
