    <Text>{center}"Report"\nSeptember 26th\nBased upon an autopsy report of\na 42 year old restaurant owner, I\nhave discovered that he has one\nof the missing gems.\nHe apparently took shelter in the\npolice department at about 10 AM,\nwhere he was shot to death within\n10 minutes of having developed the\nsymptoms.</Text>
