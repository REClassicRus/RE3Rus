    <Text>{center}DAVID'S MEMO</Text>
    <Text>My sanity is at its end... I still\ncan't believe this is happening. We\nlost another man yesterday. Meyer;\none of our better marksmen. He\nsaw me panic once we were\noverrun by the zombies, but he\ncame back to save me.\n\nBut when the time came to return\nthe debt, I ran.</Text>
    <Text>I can still hear him calling out my\nname. I can still hear the screams\ncoming from behind. The sound of\nhis flesh being stripped from its\nbones. I was afraid... terrified...</Text>
    <Text>It's the 27th. The fight to stay\nalive continues. I took out\nseveral zombies who managed to\nbreak through the barricades.\nNow I'm cutting through the chill\nwith whisky, unloading my Mossberg\non anything undead. That shotgun's\nbecome a close friend of mine. I've\nblasted many a zombie into\nfertilizer with it.</Text>
    <Text>We've lost 13 men as of yesterday.\nIn 3 hours, we'll bicker over\ntrivial things in the meeting room.\nIt's a total waste of time. When I\nfinish this bottle, my old friend\nMossberg will be turning one last\nbody into fertilizer.\n\nPeace at last.\nI can hardly wait...</Text>
