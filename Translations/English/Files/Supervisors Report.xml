    <Text>{center}SUPERVISOR'S REPORT</Text>
    <Text>The endurance ability of the\ncontaminated guinea pigs is truly\nincredible. Even when shot in a\nvital area, they can sometimes\nsurvive for several days without\ntaking care of the wound. However,\nafter prolonged exposure to the\nvirus, the guinea pigs' intelligence\nlevel decreases to that of an\ninsect.</Text>
    <Text>Even though reviving the dead\nseems too disgusting, the virus\nmay still be of use. If we inject\nthe virus into our POWs and\nrelease them, they would return to\ntheir units and then turn into\nzombies. This plan may work well\nfor us in the future.</Text>
    <Text>In certain areas, the virus seems\nto have caused the mutation of\nanimals and plants. It may be\ndifficult, but it'll make a good\nsample for the bio weapon\ndevelopment. I've heard that there\nis a giant alligator, but I have\nonly encountered a giant creature\nmoving under ground. I don't even\nwant to imagine what creature\nspawned that monster.</Text>
    <Text>I encountered "NEMESIS".\nIf I didn't know about it, I'd have\nbeen contaminated and would have\nbecome one of them by now. If it\nis still walking around in the city\nits mission is not yet over.\nS.T.A.R.S. members must be very\ntough, sincethey have survived\nuntil this point. However, they\ncannot hold out forever... </Text>
