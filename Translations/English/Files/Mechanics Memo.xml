    <Text>{center}MECHANIC'S MEMO </Text>
    <Text>I know that you're intimidated b\n your new job Kevin, so let me tell\nyou how to make sure that you\nand your trains get along just\nfine. You see, these carriages were\nmade in 1968, and then imported\nfrom Europe. Sometimes they get\nrickety, but they still work\nbecause they are simple, stubborn,\nand strong. We can always depend\non them.</Text>
    <Text>If they have a bad day and are\nmalfunctioning, you'll need to take\na good look at their circuits for\nany trouble. Once you discover\nwhat's wrong, you'll be able to fix\nit easily.</Text>
    <Text>I'm sure that you'll be able to\navoid those nasty little\nmalfunctions if you check the\nparts every day. These old trains\nwill surely have problems if you\ndon't remember to check them out.\nJust remember that if you need to\nreplace anything, you have to\nchoose a suitable part.</Text>
    <Text>When I say suitable, I mean that\neven if you can't find another\noriginal part, you'd better find\nsomething that works good enough.\nEven with regard to oil, you must\nalways prepare good quality oil\nfor these trains. Never forget\nKevin that a man may betray\nothers, but a machine won't.</Text>
